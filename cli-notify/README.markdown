# cli-notify

cli-notify (command line notify) is a command line utility that can be used to send you an on-screen notification.
It allows you to set the text and the color of the text.

Standalone Usage:

    cli-notify --text="Tests passed!" --color="#00FF00"

Client/Server Usage:

    # Start the server, default port is 8888 if no port is specified
    cli-notify --server=8888

    # Send raw JSON
    telnet localhost 8888
    Connected to localhost (127.0.0.1).
    Escape character is '^]'.
    {"text": "notification here", "color": "#FF44FF" }

Intended Usage:

    long_running_command ; cli-notify --text="It's done" --color="#00FF00"

    # use default color
    long_running_command ; cli-notify "It's done"

Examples:

    rspec spec/ ; cli-notify --text="Tests are done" --color="#00FF00"
    cucumber features/ ; cli-notify --text="Features are done" --color="#00FF00"
    rsync -avz dir1/ other1/ ; cli-notify --text="Rsync is done" --color="#00FF00"

## Running in development

This is an Adobe AIR application that is being developed using [Middleman](http://middlemanapp.com/) and [Ember.js](http://emberjs.com/). At minimum you need to have Ruby, RubyGems, and Bundler installed. With that you can run `bundle` in the project root to make sure you have middleman and its dependencies all set up.

Next, it's expected that you have the Adobe AIR SDK downloaded and set up so the `adl` command is in your PATH.

With Middleman and AIR SDK ready to go you can run `bin/run` to run the application in development. This will use middleman to build the `source/` directory into `build/` and then will use `adl` to launch the application.

`bin/run` needs to be run from the project root.

## Building

`bin/package-app` can be used to package the Adobe AIR app as a standalone Mac application which doesn't require any one to have Adobe AIR installed. It will output an Mac app (ie: `CliNotify.app`) to the `pkg/` directory.

It requires that you have a certificate file with the file extension `.pfx` in the project root. It will attempt to sign the application with that certificate. For more information on creating a self-signed certificate see http://help.adobe.com/en_US/air/build/WS5b3ccc516d4fbf351e63e3d118666ade46-7f74.html

`bin/package-app` needs to be run from the project root.

## Running the packaged app

From within the `pkg/` directory you can run:

    CliNotify.app/Contents/MacOS/cli-notify --text="hello" --color="#00FF00"

To run it from anywhere copy the `bin/cli-notify` shell script to some place accessible in your PATH like `~/bin`. Open and edit that file to provide the installation path to CliNotify.app. After that you can just run:

    cli-notify --text="hello" --color="#00FF00"

## Why not Growl?

This project was a learning experiment to play with Adobe AIR and Ember.js. By using Growl I learn nothing.
